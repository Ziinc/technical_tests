    ">Q1.1. How can we link \"Task\" to an element of type either \"ItemA\" either \"ItemB\"? An explanation or a schema (drawing) will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can place the PK for ItemA and PK for ItemB in the Items table with either A or B as optional. However, it would violate 1NF of database normalization as there would be repeating groups of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be more of a quick-and-dirty solution that would lead to technical debt in the future should more changes and complexity be needed.\n",

    "A better solution would be the answer below for Q1.2\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use a one-to-many non-optional relationship to isolate the ItemType of each Item, allowing an Item to be either A, B, C... but not allowing an Item to be both A or B at the same time.\n",
